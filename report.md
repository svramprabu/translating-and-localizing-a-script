Working on the final Assignment

## LLM Version

- used doc2txt loader in langchain to load the docx file
- as a trial used openai to translate the text and prompted in the same for a name replacement which was difficult hence tried to use simple sequential chain and then finally adapted sequential chain to process the input text.

As a whole this project felt simple to work on but learn quite a lot about prompting and langchain from the short courses in deeplearning.ai
## No-LLM Version

  Using LLM is really easy prompt and get the needed output.
  used inbuilt translator api in python to translate using google.
  tried using NER using SpaCy which isn't accurate - found some solutions for better accuracy like - pii tools, and BERT
