Working on the final Assignment

## LLM Version

-experienced trouble to use the upload function in streamlit and use the uploaded file which is as given in the assignment requirements. Ended up using the existing files in current directory and the upload needs to be done manually. Trying to overcome this and comply with the assignment requirements.
- used doc2txt loader in langchain to load the docx file
- as a trial used openai to translate the text and prompted in the same for a name replacement which was difficult hence tried to use simple sequential chain and then finally adapted sequential chain to process the input text.
-code needs a cleanup and modularity to maintain the code's viability.

As a whole this project felt simple to work on but learn quite a lot about prompting and langchain from the short courses in deeplearning.ai
## No-LLM Version

- Using LLM is really easy to prompt and get the needed output.
- used inbuilt translator api in python to translate using google.
- hard coded the languages available in google translate providing a dropdown to choose from for translation. 
- tried using NER using SpaCy which isn't accurate - found some solutions for better accuracy like - pii tools, and BERT
- but I was unable to execute the second task of name conversion in no_llm version.
